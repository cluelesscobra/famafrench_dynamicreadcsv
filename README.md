# Description

This is part of a larger project to build out a dynamic Fama French regression analysis that can be used with the yfinance api so that I can conduct a factor analysis of mutual funds. Part of the challenge with the Fama French analysis is to have a means to keep the analysis dynamic. The code directly connects to the Ken French site to pull the CSV vs. saving the updated csv on the desktop to ensure the latest version is always used in the analysis.

After some time learning python and not fully committing, this is now my first post to github and hopefully the beginning of more posts as I continue to learn. Stay tuned for the next post on building out this regression analysis.
